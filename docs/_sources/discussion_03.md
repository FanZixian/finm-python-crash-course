# 3. Agenda

- Today we will use notebooks within VS Code. We'll also begin the discussion of writing `.py` files directly. The week after that we will move away from notebooks entirely. 
- Discuss the features of using the Python and Jupyter extensions within VS Code.
  - Overview: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview
  - Variable explorer and data viewer: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer
  - Custom notebook diffing: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing
- Demonstration of Git and GitHub
  - VS Code especially makes Git diffs of Jupyter notebooks easy. Demonstrate why they are otherwise difficult.
- Finish discussion of Pandas from previous lecture:
  - Set of in-class exercises: [./src/occupations.ipynb](./_01_occupations.ipynb)
  - `03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb`
  - `03.04-Missing-Values.ipynb`
- Demonstrate Pandas in the context of factor analysis/principal components analysis of a panel (Note from 2023. Ran out of time at the beginning of discussing this notebook.)
of economic and financial time series. [./src/factor_analysis_demo.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_03_factor_analysis_demo.ipynb)
- Very quick review of Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scipy, with emphasis on plotting
  - Introduction to [NumPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html)
  - Introduction to [Matplotlib](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/matplotlib.html)
  - Compare Matplotlib to other plotting libraries: [./src/comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb](./_notebook_build/_03_comparing_plotting_libraries.ipynb)
  - Introduction to [SciPy](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/scipy.html)
