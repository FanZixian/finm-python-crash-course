# 1. Agenda

- Introduction: Who am I? What's the goal of this review?
- **Course Page on GitHub**
    - Review course page on GitHub: https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course
    - Course textbook: https://jeremybejarano.com/finm-python-crash-course/
- [**Set up Environment**](./01_setting_up_environment.md): Today we will make sure that everyone has their computational environment set
up correctly. This includes Python (via the Anaconda distribution), Visual
Studio Code, Git and GitHub, and a WRDS class count for this course.
- **Various Method of Interacting with Python**: Throughout the course, we'll
discuss the various ways of interacting with Python: Google Collab, Jupyter
Notebooks through the standard Jupyter server, Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code,
using IPython in the command line, and running Python scripts directly from the
command line (`.py` files).
- Discuss assignment for next week (installing software). (Assignments are not
  graded. This is an optional review.)
    - List of software to install is on the main README:
      https://github.com/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/README.md
    - Helpful text to understand the process of setting up your environment:
      https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/local_install.html
- [Run Python Demo Notebook in Google
  Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/week_1/Part_1_Python_Jupyter_demo.ipynb)
- Start HW1 as a group. Discuss how the Jupyter notebook can be used for HW.
  Formatting is important! [Work through problems together
  here.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jmbejara/finm-python-crash-course/blob/main/HW/HW-1-numpy-scipy/HW1.ipynb)
- With the remaining time, we'll take a step back and go over some of the more
  basic aspects of Python. We'll go through some simpler examples in the
  following notebooks (which can be accessed in Google Colab).
